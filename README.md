20 DAYS HARD

20 Days Hard is an ultra-minimal discipline tracker.
No fluff, no gamification, no ads.
Just 20 days, 5 tasks per day, and you checking them off.

This project is also an easy starting point for anyone who wants to try 75 Hard someday.
Twenty days is doable. Twenty days is realistic.
If you can’t finish 20 days, you’re definitely not ready for 75 — so this is the perfect warm-up.

The app runs entirely in the browser and uses localStorage to save your progress.
Works offline. Stays simple. Black-and-white, nothing else.
